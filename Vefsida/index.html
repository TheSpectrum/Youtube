								<p>
								Whole Youtube thing started when i came to Iceland ,It was summer 2006.<br>
								After living here for that long i noticed that my naive language (Polish) is getting worse,<br>
								So i started to record and upload videos of games on youtube to maintain what i have left from my polish.<br>
								Now i am putting a bit more effort in it even though i am not famous, i bought expesive microphone and computer,<br>
								to provide best possible quality.<br>
								<h2 class="major">My Logo</h2>
								<br>
								It all started at 7th grade when we had some kind of even in school...<br>
								For all 5 days evey day had diffrent topic and we just had fun in school<br>
								Waiting on break i drew on table two wired shapes near each orhter, <br>
								than i added some straight lines to it, and made it more crispy, <br>
								In half year and tons and tons of editing you can enjoy the very best logo of mine <br> 
								<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" />
